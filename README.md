BrickBroken[2]
==============

Free breakout game made using SLDT's GameEngine. It's the next version (complete code rewrite) of the old BrickBroken project.
Everything about BrickBroken has been cancelled.
Like precized on SLDT's Website (http://stonelins.fr), you need to use BrickBroken[2] now.

Against of the first one, this BrickBroken is completely OpenSource. However, you will find a liscence. It's the same as SLDT's GameEngine.

You must respect it or you will not get any help from me.
